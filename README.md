## Prerequisite

! NOTE ! This is not a guide on how to install nodjs or npm.

Vue/Cli and Nodjs sould be installed, which also should contain npm. This was created using node-version: 12.13.0 and npm-version: 6.12.0. If you have an older version, there are no guaranty that this setup will work.

You can check your node version by runnig the following command in your terminal:

```
node -v
```

similar for npm:

```
npm -v
```

### (A small) Installation Guide

Download and Install nodejs from: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/].
This should also give you npm. 


### Update Guide
I dont know. google it, I guess.

## How to use

### Install and Run (no build info)
Clone the repository, and run the following command inside the boiler-folder:

```
npm install --dev
```
After installing, everything should be set up to start developing as a normal Vue-project, with the added features of typescript and phaser. 

Run the following command to test your webapp (runnig at [http://localhost:8080)]:

```
npm run serve
```

If this fails, you should check your node and npm version-number (See Prerequisite). If this is not the problem, Sivert is a goof, and it is probably his fault.

--------------Jest Test-----------

Jest and Prerequisite's should be installed with npm install (see above)
Source files should be in folder "src"
Test files should be in folder "tests"

To run tests use:
#npm t

To run tests with coverage:
#npm run coverage
